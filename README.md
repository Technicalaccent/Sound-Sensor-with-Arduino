Sound Sensor with Arduino


What are the types of sound sensors?

There are different types of microphones that are known as sound sensors like dynamic, condenser, ribbon, carbon, etc.


What are the advantages of a sound sensor?

Sound sensors can be used for security systems, often it works with speech recognition software where sound or speech is converted to text. This is a faster approach compared to typing using a keyboard.


What is the range of the sound sensor?

This sensor is capable of determining noise levels within 100 dB's or decibels at 3 kHz, 6 kHz frequencies range, approximately.


Can Arduino detect sound?

You'll learn how to use the KY-038 sound detection sensor with Arduino. You can measure changes in the intensity of sound in an environment with the ADC of the Arduino.
